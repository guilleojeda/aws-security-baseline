AWS Security Baseline
This repo contains a simple to apply security baseline for new AWS accounts.

security-baseline-account.yaml:
CloudTrail and S3 bucket: CloudTrail is enabled to log AWS API calls, and an S3 bucket is created to store these logs.
IAM Users and Groups: An IAM user is created with a temporary password and added to the Administrators group.
AWS Budgets: Four AWS Budgets are created to monitor and notify when the forecasted or actual spend exceeds the specified limits.
AWS Config: AWS Config is enabled, and an S3 bucket is created to store configuration snapshots.
AWS Config Rules: A Config Rule is created to check for required tags on specified resource types.
AWS Security Hub: Security Hub is enabled, and the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark standard is subscribed to.
VPC: A VPC is created with DNS support and hostnames enabled.
VPC Flow Logs: VPC Flow Logs are enabled, and an S3 bucket is configured as the log destination.
Baseline Security Group: A baseline security group is created with default ingress and egress rules.
KMS Key and SNS Topic: A KMS key is created for SNS message encryption, and an SNS topic is created to send security notifications.
EBS Encryption Lambda Function: A Lambda function is created to automatically enable encryption on unencrypted EBS volumes.

The following outputs are generated by the template:
S3BucketName: The name of the S3 bucket created for CloudTrail logs.
SNSTopicArn: The ARN of the SNS Topic created for security notifications.
IAMUserPassword: The temporary password for the IAM user created in the Administrators group.

To deploy the template, follow these steps:
Save the template as a YAML file, e.g., security_baseline.yaml.
Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudFormation service.
Choose "Create Stack" and select "With new resources (standard)".
Upload the security_baseline.yaml file and click "Next".
Fill in any required parameters, such as email addresses for AWS Budget notifications, and click "Next".
Configure stack options if needed and click "Next".
Review the stack settings and click "Create Stack" to start the deployment.
Once the stack is created, you can view the outputs in the CloudFormation console.
